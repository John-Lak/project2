      <p>
        Nam is from Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam — a busy and exciting city known for its history, street food, and old temples. He lived in District 7 for about 10 years before moving to Australia. His neighborhood was small, crowded, and a bit dirty, but full of friendly people. Every afternoon, he would hang out with his neighbors, play games, and enjoy his time. These moments were a big part of his childhood and something he still remembers fondly.

        John is from Hyderabad, India — a city known for its rich history, culture, and technology. He was born and lived in Auckland, New Zealand for about 1 year before moving to Australia. His neighborhood was lively and full of friendly people. Every evening, he would play cricket with his friends and enjoy the local food. These moments were a big part of his childhood and something he still cherishes.
